# Practice-Smart-Contracts GitHub Repository README

Welcome to the Practice-Smart-Contracts repository! This repository serves as a collection of various Solidity smart contract examples for educational and practice purposes. Each contract demonstrates different concepts and functionalities that are commonly used in the development of decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchain platforms.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Chai.sol
- **Description**: A simple ERC20 token contract named Chai, which can be used to understand basic token functionalities like minting, transferring, and burning tokens.

### 2. ConcertTickets.sol
- **Description**: A contract for managing concert tickets. It demonstrates how to create, sell, and validate tickets using blockchain technology.

### 3. EcoMarket.sol
- **Description**: An example of a decentralized marketplace where users can buy and sell goods. It showcases how to implement trading mechanisms and escrow services.
